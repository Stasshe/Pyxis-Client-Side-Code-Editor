# User Change Protection Test

This document describes how to test the user change protection mechanism.

## Test Scenario 1: User typing while external save occurs

1. Open a file in the editor
2. Start typing content 
3. Within 0.5 seconds, trigger an external save operation (terminal, git, aiagent)
4. Verify that the user's changes are NOT discarded
5. Verify that the cursor position is preserved

## Test Scenario 2: External operation priority

1. Open a file in the editor  
2. Start typing content
3. Trigger a terminal/git/aiagent operation that modifies the same file
4. Verify that the external operation takes priority (as per requirements)
5. Verify that user changes after external operation are preserved

## Implementation Details

### User Change Protection Mechanism

1. **Timestamp Tracking**: Each user change records a `userChangeTimestamp` in the tab
2. **Recent Change Detection**: Changes within 0.5 seconds are considered "recent"
3. **Sync Protection**: The sync effect checks for recent user changes and skips sync if found
4. **External Operation Tracking**: All external operations (terminal, git, aiagent) set `externalOperationInProgress` flag
5. **Priority Handling**: External operations override user protection as required

### Key Changes Made

1. Added `userChangeTimestamp` to Tab interface
2. Modified `handleTabContentChangeImmediate` to record timestamps
3. Updated `useProjectFilesSyncEffect` to check for recent user changes
4. Added `externalOperationInProgress` flag for broader operation tracking
5. Protected editor content sync in CodeEditor component

### Code Flow

```
User types → recordUserChange() → userChangeTimestamp set
External operation → setExternalOperationInProgress(true) → forces sync
Sync effect → checks hasRecentUserChange() → skips if recent AND not external op
```

This ensures user changes are preserved unless overridden by external operations with higher priority.
